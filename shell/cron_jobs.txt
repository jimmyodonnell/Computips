The timing sequence of a cron job looks like this:

* * * * *

The first asterisk is for specifying the minute of the run (0-59)
The second asterisk is for specifying the hour of the run (0-23)
The third asterisk is for specifying the day of the month for the run (1-31)
The fourth asterisk is for specifying the month of the run (1-12)
The fifth asterisk is for specifying the day of the week (where Sunday is equal to 0, up to Saturday is equal to 6)
So, let's take a look at some examples:

If you wanted to run the job every day at 1:00 p.m., then you could use the following cron job timing sequence:

0 13 * * *

If you wanted the job to run every 30 minutes, you could use the following sequence:

30 * * * *

And, lastly, if you wanted the job to run once a week on Wednesday, you could type the following sequence:

* * * * 3

* * * * * *
