# To get JAGS running through R on a Mac, you first have to install JAGS.

# The easiest way to install JAGS is using Homebrew.

# To get Homebrew, you need the Mac command line tools installed.

# To check if the command line tools are installed, you can type:

xcode-select -p

# and if they are installed, it will show the path to the directory where they live.
# Alternatively, (or if they aren't installed), you can just type a command at the command line (Terminal.app) that relies on them:

make

# or

gcc

# If they aren't installed, you'll get an error and a prompt asking if you'd like to install them.
# Press enter when it prompts to show you the license agreement. Press q to exit the license agreement view. Type 'agree'.
# If they are installed, you'll get an error from one of those programs saying you didn't give it any input files (e.g. 'clang: error: no input files')


# If you don't have homebrew, you can use the following command to install it (relies on the command line tools!) (currently from http://brew.sh/)

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


# Then, use Homebrew to install JAGS

brew install jags

# Then, in R, install the package R2jags, which should also install some other packages on which it depends.
# You can do this right from the same terminal window!

R
install.packages("R2jags") # should prompt you to choose the server you want to download from

# you should be all set!
