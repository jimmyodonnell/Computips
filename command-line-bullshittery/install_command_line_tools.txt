# To check if the command line tools are installed, you can type:

xcode-select -p

# and if they are installed, it will show the path to the directory where they live.
# Alternatively, (or if they aren't installed), you can just type a command at the command line (Terminal.app) that relies on them:

make

# or

gcc

# If they aren't installed, you'll get an error and a prompt asking if you'd like to install them.
# Press enter when it prompts to show you the license agreement. Press q to exit the license agreement view. Type 'agree'.
# If they are installed, you'll get an error from one of those programs saying you didn't give it any input files (e.g. 'clang: error: no input files')
