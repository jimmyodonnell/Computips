# to install swarm:

#1 Download the zip file from the github page (right hand side)

#2 unzip it
unzip swarm-master.zip -d swarm

#3 open a terminal and cd to the directory "src" in the newly unzipped directory
cd ~/Downloads/swarm-master/src

#4 type "make" at the terminal once you're in the directory /swarm/src
make

#5 this will create the executable (program) file 'swarm' in the directory "bin" in the "swarm-master" folder

#6 copy that file to a folder in your "PATH". The folder '/usr/bin' is a fine one
cp ../bin/swarm /usr/bin/swarm
# if it says permission denied, you can get permission by typing "sudo cp ../bin/swarm /usr/bin/swarm"

#7 put the manual in the same place so you can access it from the terminal by typing "man swarm"
cd ../man
gzip -c swarm.1 > swarm.1.gz
mv swarm.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/

# all set!
