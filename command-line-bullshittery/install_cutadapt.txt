Here's how I install/upgrade cutadapt:

#1. Make sure you have "pip" installed: (Homebrew installs pip and easy_install, I think... so if this step doesn't work, trying installing homebrew first.)
sudo easy_install pip

#2. Install cutadapt using pip:
sudo pip install cutadapt

# if it's already installed:
sudo pip install cutadapt --upgrade

cutadapt --version
# 1.7.1
