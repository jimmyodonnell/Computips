To include graphics from a folder/directory other than the one in which the .tex file lives:

# 1: Add \graphicspath {{figures/}} before \begin{document}
\graphicspath{{/Users/my_username/Projects/my_project/figures/}}

# more generally:
\graphicspath{{subdir1/}{subdir2/}{subdir3/}...{subdirn/}}

# 2: Reference the path to the file relative to the .tex file directory.
# If your directory hierarchy looks like this:
my_project/ 
		|--- Analysis/
		|--- Data/
		|--- Figures/
				|--- figure1.pdf
		|--- Manuscript/
				|--- manuscript.tex

# then for each figure, the reference should look like this:
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/figure1.pdf}
